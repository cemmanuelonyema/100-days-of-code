# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamps Introduction to Basic HTML & HTML5 section, Continuing Frontend Masters Online Bootcamp - Introduction to CSS section.

**Thoughts** After two bad attempts at #100daysOfCode this is the big one, I plan on building more projects and creating a professional portfolio through coursework, reading, and coding. I have a few challenges and paid for courses in mind. I'm also considering time-boxing this round to not stay on the same subject too long.

### Day 2: November 16, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic CSS and continued the CSS section of the boot camp, have some exercises to finish for the Bootcamp tomorrow, just some basic CSS markup.

**Thoughts**: Glad I'm back at it, I'm going to be super consistent this time. I really want to build a portfolio I can be proud of.

### Day 3: November 17, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Spent the entire hour on FreeCodeCamps Applied Visual Design.

**Thoughts**: Learned some cool CSS animation functions, didn't have time to do the CSS section of the boot camp today because all 3 pomodoros were spent on FCC. Plus I'm going to pick up another course from Wes Bos when I make it to the CSS Flexbox and Grid to have a better understanding of them this time. I want my sites to look cool and have good UX and functionality!

### Day 4: November 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Accessibility on FreeCodeCamp and finished one of the two CSS practice exercises on the FrontEnd Masters bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: The recent days have shown me that I need to create more content, I make simple mistakes like linking the CSS stylesheet to the wrong folder. I haven't made many websites or practiced toy coding problems, so In return I have become weak and sloppy. All that ends!!! MOTIVATION comes with ACTION

### Day 5: November 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Made A lot of progress! Finished FreeCodeCamps Responsive Web Design Principles section and started the CSS Flexbox section, realized I was doing a lot of CSS in FCC and the FrontEnd Masters bootcamp, and I'm supposed to be time-boxing only on the subject of HTML, so I started reading and coding along with the online tutorial "Interneting Is Hard". Wrote some HTML and downloaded and used Atom editor for the first time and it looks pretty cool :)

**Thoughts**: I haven't had this much fun coding in a while! The hour flew by fast, I even skipped a break during the pomodoros. I'm ready to get the basics down packed so I can move on to Javascript and Python. Wes Bos courses are on sale so I'm probably gonna purchase some, plus Black Friday is coming next week so I'm buying some Udemy courses on JS also.

### Day 6: November 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Watching FreeCodeCamps 2hr HTML Course for 1 hour.

**Thoughts**: Had a very busy day outside of coding preparing for a meetup with NWC tomorrow, so I'm just going to stay within the HTML timebox but I'm too tired to read and code. Learning as much as I can about HTML, I have 2 more days to finish the online book and this video course.

### Day 7: November 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading and coding along with "Interneting Is Hard"

**Thoughts**: Having some real fun with HTML in this online book, learning a few new tricks with anchor links and website structure. I really did need this crash course in the basics. I need to stick to it. Tomorrow I will be done with the HTML section of the book, and I can finish up the FCC HTML video course. Then I have 8 days of CSS.

### Day 8: November 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished reading "Interneting Is Hard" HTML section, skimmed over FrontEndMasters Bootcamp HTML Reference and also took the HTML Quiz on W3schools and got a 90%! I scored 36 out of 40 points.

**Thoughts**: This time-boxing method of studying a certain subject for me seems to pay off. I thought I would do okay on the quiz but not a 90. I start CSS tomorrow so I'm getting back to the BootCamp and FreeCodeCamp, plus I'm going to finish reading the CSS section of Interneting is Hard and do the Wes Bos courses on Flexbox and CSS Grid. CSS is a big subject so It's easy to get caught up. I also can't forget about Flexbox Zombies, honestly I can easily commit to 100days of CSS, LoL :D

### Day 9: November 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the CSS section of my time-boxing schedule. Finished the Flexbox section of FCC Curriculum, started Wes Bos Course What The Flexbox to complement it and I also continued the CSS Spacing section of the FrontEnd Masters bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: Learned a lot today! Like that even though all webpages look 2D they are actually 3D because of the Z-Index. I'm moving through these courses and curriculum faster than I guessed. I hope I finish the Wes Bos course by at least day 11 because I don't want to spend too much time on CSS vast sea of subjects. I aslo need to finish reading the CSS section of "Interneting Is Hard" so I have plenty of work to do, and can't forget about Flexbox Zombies.

### Day 10: November 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Wes Bos "What The Flexbox" course

**Thoughts**: Learned some real interesting tricks in Flexbox, it seems to be very useful, especially with postioning and aligning items on a page. It's power to make a site responsive seems to be unlimited, I see why the developer community is pushing it. I want to write a blog post over all I have currently learned but don't know where to start.

### Day 11: November 26, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the CSS Grid exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Missed yesterday due to a family emergency, today is Thanksgiving so I hung out with family, took time to code on my phone for an hour. Also received "Javascript: The Weird Parts" course on Udemy as a gift from my mentor today!

### Day 12: November 27, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Wes Bos What The Flexbox course.

**Thoughts**: Trying to finish up the Flexbox Course so I can get back on the FrontEnd Masters Course and Start the Wes Bos CSS Grid Course. My CSS days will be very productive. Thinking about doing a 4 hour session tomorrow to get some work done and solidify the things I'm learning, I never feel like I write enough CSS. Now that I'm focusing on it I should do some exercises on W3schools on it also.

### Day 13: November 28, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued What The Flexbox course.

**Thoughts**: This course is AWESOME! It really shows the power behind Flexbox and CSS. I've seen the subject of combination power of CSS and JS but I'm just now seeing how it works in a real world application today. In todays lesson I had to download NodeJS and Gulp to Auto-Fix some CSS. I was not successful due to a system error, I'm pretty sure its my version of windows being that my laptop is pretty old and lacks a lot of windows security and build files. The attempt excited me! I didn't want to spend the entire night trying to fix an error on gulp and I dont have the JS experience to fix it. It was all super fun and I can't wait to get better and start deploying my own content to the web!

### Day 14: November 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued What The Flexbox course.

### Day 0: June 27, Monday -EXAMPLE-

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
