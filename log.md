# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamps Introduction to Basic HTML & HTML5 section, Continuing Frontend Masters Online Bootcamp - Introduction to CSS section.

**Thoughts** After two bad attempts at #100daysOfCode this is the big one, I plan on building more projects and creating a professional portfolio through coursework, reading, and coding. I have a few challenges and paid for courses in mind. I'm also considering time-boxing this round in order to not stay on the same subject too long.

### Day 2: November 16, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic CSS and continued the CSS section of the bootcamp, have some exercises to finish for the Bootcamp tomorrow, just some basic CSS markup.

**Thoughts**: Glad I'm back at it, I'm going to be super consistent this time. I really want to build a portfolio I can be proud of.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
