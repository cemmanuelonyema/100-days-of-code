# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamps Introduction to Basic HTML & HTML5 section, Continuing Frontend Masters Online Bootcamp - Introduction to CSS section.

**Thoughts** After two bad attempts at #100daysOfCode this is the big one, I plan on building more projects and creating a professional portfolio through coursework, reading, and coding. I have a few challenges and paid for courses in mind. I'm also considering time-boxing this round in order to not stay on the same subject too long.

### Day 0: June 27, Monday -EXAMPLE-

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
