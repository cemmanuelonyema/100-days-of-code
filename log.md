# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamps Introduction to Basic HTML & HTML5 section, Continuing Frontend Masters Online Bootcamp - Introduction to CSS section.

**Thoughts** After two bad attempts at #100daysOfCode this is the big one, I plan on building more projects and creating a professional portfolio through coursework, reading, and coding. I have a few challenges and paid for courses in mind. I'm also considering time-boxing this round to not stay on the same subject too long.

2. [Introduction to CSS](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/introduction-css/)

### Day 2: November 16, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic CSS and continued the CSS section of the boot camp, have some exercises to finish for the Bootcamp tomorrow, just some basic CSS markup.

**Thoughts**: Glad I'm back at it, I'm going to be super consistent this time. I really want to build a portfolio I can be proud of.

### Day 3: November 17, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Spent the entire hour on FreeCodeCamps Applied Visual Design.

**Thoughts**: Learned some cool CSS animation functions, didn't have time to do the CSS section of the boot camp today because all 3 pomodoros were spent on FCC. Plus I'm going to pick up another course from Wes Bos when I make it to the CSS Flexbox and Grid to have a better understanding of them this time. I want my sites to look cool and have good UX and functionality!

### Day 4: November 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Accessibility on FreeCodeCamp and finished one of the two CSS practice exercises on the FrontEnd Masters bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: The recent days have shown me that I need to create more content, I make simple mistakes like linking the CSS stylesheet to the wrong folder. I haven't made many websites or practiced toy coding problems, so In return I have become weak and sloppy. All that ends!!! MOTIVATION comes with ACTION

### Day 5: November 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Made A lot of progress! Finished FreeCodeCamps Responsive Web Design Principles section and started the CSS Flexbox section, realized I was doing a lot of CSS in FCC and the FrontEnd Masters bootcamp, and I'm supposed to be time-boxing only on the subject of HTML, so I started reading and coding along with the online tutorial "Interneting Is Hard". Wrote some HTML and downloaded and used Atom editor for the first time and it looks pretty cool :)

**Thoughts**: I haven't had this much fun coding in a while! The hour flew by fast, I even skipped a break during the pomodoros. I'm ready to get the basics down packed so I can move on to Javascript and Python. Wes Bos courses are on sale so I'm probably gonna purchase some, plus Black Friday is coming next week so I'm buying some Udemy courses on JS also.

### Day 6: November 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Watching FreeCodeCamps 2hr HTML Course for 1 hour.

**Thoughts**: Had a very busy day outside of coding preparing for a meetup with NWC tomorrow, so I'm just going to stay within the HTML timebox but I'm too tired to read and code. Learning as much as I can about HTML, I have 2 more days to finish the online book and this video course.

### Day 0: June 27, Monday -EXAMPLE-

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
